# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for contributing! :tada: Here are some guidelines to contributing to this repository. These are guidelines, not rules, but please try your best to adhere to them!

## Github

### Commits

- Start commit message with uppercase letter
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Reference issues and pull requests

### Pull Requests

When initially opening a pull request, please open it in **draft** mode, and do not mark it for review. Please fill out the template with as much detail as you can.

Once you are done implementing the feature, make sure that your code follows the style guides laid out in the `client` and `api` readmes, and all status checks are passing. Then, mark the pull request as ready for review.

Start pull request titles with emojis!

| `documentation` :book: | An issue with the documentation. This may include incorrect or insufficient information.           |
| `feature` :star2:      | A new feature request for the application. This will be paired with a priority label if accepted.  |
| `P0`                   | Highest priority feature that must be implemented before the MVP.                                  |
| `P1`                   | Features to be implemented after MVP, that are critical for application functionality.             |
| `P2`                   | Stretch goals for the applicataion. All features with this label are of relatively low importance. |

    testimonial: `"The Welcome Center has become a home
                  to me. I understood I was an ally of the
                  immigrant population, but I was sedentary in
                  my actions which made me part of the problem.
                  I saw this opportunity to become active in
                  how I felt, not just think about it, and
                  do something about it. Now I'm here."`,

                    the stress I had before, all the insecurities I had.

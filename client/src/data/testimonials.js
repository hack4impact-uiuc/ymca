    testimonial: `"The Welcome Center has become a home
                  to me. I understood I was an ally of the
                  immigrant population, but I was sedentary in
                  my actions which made me part of the problem.
                  I saw this opportunity to become active in
                  how I felt, not just think about it, and
                  do something about it. Now I'm here."`,

                    know what to do. I didn't have any idea. YMCA
                    helped me fill those papers. It's taken away all
                    the stress I had before, all the insecurities I had.
                    I know the door I can knock on for advice and ideas
                    for what I can do. "`,
